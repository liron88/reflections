Use git init to initialize a new repository.

command						comparing commits that are found in
------------------------	-----------------------------------
git diff					working directory	staging area
git diff --staged			staging area		commit1
git diff commit1 commit2	commit1				commit2

Using the command git status, one can see which files are in the staging
area and which files are untracked (files that are found only in the
working directory). Only those files that are in the staging area will
be committed. To commit per logical change, insert only the relevant
files for the logical change to the staging area (using the command
git add).

git branch shows all the branches that were created.
a star next to a branch's name indicates that this is the current branch.
git branch [branch name] creates a new branch called [branch name]
git checkout [branch name] switches to a branch named [branch name]

git checkout -b [branch name]
equals
git branch [branch name]
git checkout [branch name]

this is useful when creating a new commit that is not found on any branch
just yet.
	
git show [commit] - diffs [commit] and its parent (without knowing the
parent id).
git branch -d [branch name] - deletes branch [branch name]. d means delete.
If this is done after [branch name] was merged into some other merge (say
master branch), the commits in [branch name] will be accessible through
git log in the master branch.
	
git merge --abort - aborts merging and restore the files to the state
before the merge.
	
git log --graph --oneline - shows a graph of the branches.

git remote - see all current GitHub repositories (their local name are
remotes).
git remote -v - some added information (from where is fetch done and to
where push is done).
git remote add origin [some URL of repository] - adds a repository which exists
in the specified [URL]. This [URL] will be referred to as "origin". You can
rename it to whatever you like.
git push [origin] [master] - pushes branch [master] into remote [origin].

git fetch branch-name
	
git pull origin master = 	git fetch master
							git merge master origin/master
