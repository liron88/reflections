What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    A repository is initialized. That means there are no commits yet,
	but only untracked files.
	There's a need to do it because later we'll use that repository to
	commit dependent files at once.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is a intermediate step used when preparing to commit.
	Only those files that were added to the staging area from the working
	directory will commit to the repository. It is different from the
	working directory because it "knows" which files are to be committed (which
	is not always all the files). It is different from the repository by the 
	fact that it does contain information about the files in the working
	directory (e.g. untracked files).
	It offers the value of freedom the chose which files from the working
	directory will be committed.
